# This file is the configuration of IOHProfiler experiments.
# Users can run specific experiments by using this file and `user_algorithm.c` together.

# The configuration consist of three parts: [suite], [observer], and [triggers].
# It is highly recommended not to add or delete any sentences in the file.
# Modify the value of keys to suit expected experiments, otherwise keep them as default values.

#------------------- 1 -------------------
# Suite is a collection of problems.
# Currently, ONLY `PBO` suite is avaiable, please do not modify the value of `suite_name`,
# unless a new suite is created. See `introduction` for developers to know how to created
# your own suite.
#
# `function_id` presents id of problems of the suite. For `PBO`:
# `1` is OneMax,
# `2` is LeadingOnes,
# `3` is Jump function,
# `4` is Linear function.
# The format of `function_id` can be `1,2,3,4`, using comma `,` to separate problems' id,
# or be `1-4`, using an en-dash `-` to present the range of problems' id. 
#
# `instances_id` presents id of instances. instances decide the transformer operations on
# problems. For `PBO`:
# `1` : no transformer operations on the problem.
# `2-50` :  XOR and SHIFT operations are applied on the problem.
# `51-100`: SIGMA and SHIFT operations are applied on the problem.
# The format of `instances_id` can be `1,2,3,4`, using comma `,` to separate instances' id,
# or be `1-100`, using an en-dash `-` to present the range of instances' id. 
# All parameters of operations are generated with pseudo random numbers.
# See details in https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05281 .
#
# `dimensions` presents dimensions of problems. It is not supported to set sepecfic dimensions
# for each problem, which means all selected problems will be tested with the same dimensions.
# The format of `dimensions` is as `500,1000,1500`.
#
# ATTENTION! Values of all keys of suite must be surrounded by double qutation marks `"`.

#------------------- 2 -------------------
# Observer is about the setting of output files.
# Currently, ONLY `PBO` observer is avaiable, please do not modify the value of `observer_name`,
# unless a new observer is created. See `introduction` for developers to know how to created
# your own observer.
#
# `result_folder` is the name of folder where stores output files. If the folder doesnot exist,
# a new folder will be created in current path.
#
# `algorithms_name` and `algorithm_info` are additional information of algorithms. It will be used
# when generating the `.info` files.
#
# ATTENTION! Values of all keys of observer must be surrounded by double qutation marks `"`.

#------------------- 3 -------------------
# Triggers are parameters for different output files. Values of triggers will effect the output
# of corresponding output files.
#
# `complete_triggers` is the switch of `.cdat` files, which will store evaluations of all iterations.
# Set `complete_triggers` as `TRUE` or `true` if you want to output `.cdat` files.
#
# both `number_target_triggers` and `base_evaluation_triggers` effect `.tdat`. 
# `number_target_triggers` is a value defines the number of evaluations to be logged between 10^i
# and 10^(i+1).
# `base_evaluation_triggers` defines the base evaluations used to produce an additional
# evaluation-based logging. For example, if `base_evaluation_triggers` = `1,2,5`, the logger will be 
# triggered by evaluations dim*1, dim*2, dim*5, 10*dim*1, 10*dim*2, 10*dim*5, 100*dim*1, 100*dim*2, 
# 100*dim*5, ... . If you do not want to generate `.tdat` files, set `base_evaluation_triggers` as ``.
#
# `number_target_triggers` works on `*.dat` files. It is a value defines the number of targets between
# 10^i and 10^(i+1). If you do not want to generate `.dat` files, set `number_target_triggers` as 0.
#
# `number_interval_triggers` works on the `*.idat` files. `*.idat` files log evaluations in a fixed 
# frequecny. number_target_triggers sets the value of the frequecny. If you do not want to generate
# `.dat` files, set `number_target_triggers` as 0.
#
# ATTENTION! Values of `complete_triggers` and `base_evaluation_triggers` of suite must be surrounded 
# by double qutation marks `"`.
