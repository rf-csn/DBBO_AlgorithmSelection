Using IOHprofiler by C 
==============================================

Getting started
---------------

See [here](../../../README.md#Getting-Started) for the first steps and execute the 
```
python do.py build-c
``` 

To run your experiment using the tool, following files are necessary:
- `IOHprofiler.h` Headfile for source code.
- `IOHprofiler.c` source code for the project.
- `readcfg.c`, `configuration.ini` Configs of problems.
- `user_experiment.c` An interface to assign problems for the experiment.
- `user_algorithm.c` the file including implementation of the algorithm to be tested.
- `Makefile.in`

With these files, you can invoke **make** to compile, then run your experiment. To specify the experiment, you need to take care of [_Configuration_](#Configuration) and [_Implementation of Algorithms_](#Algorithms). 

###	Configuration <a name="Configuration"></a>
`Configuration.ini` consists of three parts: **[suite]**, **[observer]** and **[triggers]**.

*	**[suite]** is the session that collects problems to be tested in the experiment. 
	*	`suite_name`: Currently, ONLY `PBO` suite is avaiable,  please do not modify the value of `suite_name`, unless a new suite is created. 
	*	`function_id`: presents id of problems of the suite. The format of `function_id` can be `1,2,3,4` using comma `,` to separate problems' id, or be `1-4` using an en-dash `-` to present the range of problems' id. 
	*	`instances_id`: presents id of instances. Instanes 1 means there is no transformer operations on the problem. For instances 2-50, XOR and SHIFT operations are applied on the problem. For instances 5-100, SIGMA and SHIFT operations are applied on the problem. Larger instances ID will be considered as 1.
	*	`dimensions`: presents dimensions of problems. The format of `dimensions` is as `500,1000,1500`.

*	**[observer]** is about the setting of output files. 
	*	`observer_name`: Currently, ONLY `PBO` observer is avaiable, please do not modify the value of `observer_name`, unless a new observer is created.
	*	`result_folder`: Directory where stores output files.
	*	`algorithm_name`: used for .info files.
	*	`algorithm_info`: user for .info files.
	*	`parameters_name`: names for recording parameters in algorithms.

*	**[triggers]** are parameters for different output files, see [documentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05281.pdf) to know technique of recording evluations.
	*	`number_target_triggers`, `base_evaluation_triggers`: are for .tdat files.
	*	`complete_triggers`: is for .cdat files.
	*	`number_interval_triggers`: is for .idat files.

###	Implementation of Algorithm <a name="Algorithms"></a>
`user_algorithm.c` includes the implementation of algorithms to be tested. Take the exiting `user_algorithm.c` as an example, a random local search algorithm is implemented in the function **User_Algorithm()**. 

```
static const size_t BUDGET_MULTIPLIER = 50;
```
configs the maximal budget for evaluations as dimension * 50.

```
static const size_t INDEPENDENT_RESTARTS = 1;
```
configs that the algorithm will be tested once for each problem.

```
evalute(parent,y)
```
returns the fitness of **parent** to **y**. The size of **parent**
should be equal to the dimension of the problem.

To test your algorithm, please replace the content of **User_Algorithm()**.
